CSC440 Cloud Drive Project Team 1
By Abdulsalam Bdeir, William Rood, Jae Park, and Kevin Tran

The aim of this cloud drive is to allow users to register onto a web server that would host services that would allow registered users to upload, download, and share files with
other users also registered.

The server uses a both the MySQL server and the linux OS to help store, organize, and keep track of files uploaded and deleted from the server.
